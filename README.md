* The application fetches document details (type, title, and position ) from a data.json file located in the project directory.

* Documents are displayed in cards arranged in a grid, with three cards in the first row and two in the second.

* While image data is being fetched, a loading spinner is displayed within the thumbnail container.
* You can drag and drop cards to reorder them within the grid.
* Clicking on a card displays a larger version of the document image in an overlay centered on the page.
* Pressing the Escape key while the image overlay is visible will close the overlay.
